Why start a blog?

As I'm writing this, I have various loosely coupled reasons, and lots of doubts. But just as with some decisions, there will be no end to thinking and deliberating, and this is one of those. So sometimes, it's best to just say yes, and go from there.

I've always had an inclination to write, but the problem is that I have nothing really interesting to write about, and it's still true. However, on the many nights and weekends when I am free, I find my mind wandering, on the most random trains of thought, and I always come back to the idea of this blog.

In addition, now that I'm a couple years out of college, I find it a pretty odd place to be. It's harder to judge progress, as you aren't taking new courses every semester or learning new things every year, and it's easy to feel as if the days and months blend together. It's also not easy to get/have a job where you are learning new things constantly, and whatever I've learnt about in college, I've also mostly forgot. So what exactly is the sum total of my knowledge/understanding?

It's this general feeling of mental malaise that led me to starting this blog, by [writing](https://www.paulgraham.com/words.html) about the things I'm working on, perhaps I can better synthesize and maintain my knowledge. So, a big part of the motivation comes for the need for some mental exercise and discipline.

And lastly, if there are any interesting "meta" thoughts which I find substantial enough to write about, I'd commit those to a post as well.

Here's to hoping that there are more posts to come! ;)
