Hi there! Thanks for dropping by.

Writing an about me is challenging for someone whose idea of a great weekend most times is staying home, so let's start with the easy facts.

I'm a [Penangite](https://mypenangstories.wordpress.com/2016/08/30/qualities-of-a-true-blue-penangite/) (from island!) currently working as a software engineer in San Diego.

When not working, I try to stay committed to my health through running and playing tennis. I run more for maintaining my health than setting a new PR, but that may change ;). As for tennis, I'm currently working on beating pushers consistently.

I don't consider myself well-versed when it comes to TV shows and sitcoms, but here's a few that I enjoy watching or grew up on:

- Gilmore Girls
- Golden Girls
- Phua Chu Kang
- HK dramas

I'm not very well-read either, and I did most of my reading when I was a kid, so the books that made the most impression on me were:

- Enid Blyton's books, in particular the Enchanted Wood series, and Malory Towers
- Anne of Green Gables
- Harry Potter

and also for a while, I was engrossed with The Inheritance Cycle. 

And there, you have it!
